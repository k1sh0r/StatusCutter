# StatusCutter
A minimalistic way to cut your (15 seconds) videos for whatsapp and instagram in windows. It can also be used in linux/unix by changing some directories in these files.


There are 3 things needed for this to work
1. Localhost Server and browser. [Download XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
2. Python3 [Download Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. moviepy python module [Official installation instruction](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html)

Setting up
1. Add .py handler to the httd.conf file in apache to allow py scripts to run. [Watch how](https://youtu.be/WhI8MYn8qpo?t=64)
2. Clone this repository to the localhost directory
3. In cutter.py line-1 add the directory in which you've installed python in your computer.
4. Visit localhost/path/you/have/cloned/to/StatusCutter/index.html from localhost in the browser

The rest is self explanatory I guess.
